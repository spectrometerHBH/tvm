TIRx Basics: Native Level
=========================

.. note::

   Draft. The **native level** is where you write kernels directly — placing
   threads, allocating buffers, writing loops and barriers, and calling device
   intrinsics — *below* the tile primitives. It maps almost one-to-one to the
   target's native programming model.

What "native level" means
-------------------------

A native-level TIRx kernel reads like a structured device kernel: you place
threads yourself, allocate shared/register buffers, write loops and barriers, and
call device intrinsics directly. There is no automatic scheduling — what you write
is what is emitted. This is the foundation the tile primitives
(:doc:`tile_primitives`) are built on; everything here is what those primitives
ultimately lower to, so it is also where you go when a hardware feature does not
have a primitive yet.

The shared model
----------------

The authoring model is the same across backends:

- ``@T.prim_func`` (or ``@T.jit`` for compile-time-specialized) kernels, written
  with ``from tvm.script import tirx as T``;
- ``T.device_entry()`` plus *scope-id* intrinsics for thread binding;
- ``T.match_buffer`` parameters and ``T.alloc_*`` scratch buffers;
- ordinary loops, branches, and scalar math;
- ``tvm.compile(mod, target=..., tir_pipeline="tirx")`` to build, then call the
  result directly.

What differs per backend is the concrete set of memory scopes, synchronization
and device intrinsics, and the generated source. Pick your backend:

(Support for additional backends, e.g. ROCm, will appear here as it lands.)
